## Introduction
The Diffusion-based Voice Conversion Model is a state-of-the-art voice conversion framework that leverages diffusion processes to achieve high-quality voice synthesis. This project aims to convert the voice of one speaker to another while preserving the linguistic content and naturalness of the speech.

## Features
- High-quality voice conversion using diffusion processes.
- Support for various datasets such as CREMA, LRW_full_size, avspeech, and vox.
- Customizable model architecture and training settings.
- Preprocessing scripts for audio and video data.
- Efficient inference with pre-trained models.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diffusion-voice-conversion.git
   cd diffusion-voice-conversion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download datasets:**
   Place your datasets in the `datasets` directory following the structure mentioned in the [Data Preparation](#data-preparation) section.

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Organize your datasets as follows:
```
datasets/
├── audio/
│   ├── s1/
│   │   ├── 1001_DFA_DIS_XX.wav
│   ├── s2/
│   │   ├── 1002_DFA_DIS_XX.wav
│   └── ...
├── video/
│   ├── s1/
│   │   ├── 1001_DFA_DIS_XX.mp4
│   ├── s2/
│   │   ├── 1002_DFA_DIS_XX.mp4
│   └── ...
```

### Training
To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
```
Modify the `config/train_config.yaml` to set your training parameters.

### Inference
For inference, use the following command:
```bash
python infer.py --input audio.wav --output converted_audio.wav --model_path checkpoints/model.pth
```
Ensure that the model checkpoint is specified correctly.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture includes:
- **UNet**: Used for encoding and decoding audio features.
- **Diffusion Process**: Applied to enhance the quality of voice conversion.
- **Speaker Encoder**: Extracts speaker embeddings from input audio.

## Results
Here you can showcase some of the results obtained using your model, including audio samples and quantitative metrics.
